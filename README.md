commit
======

commit is a simple script for light git users, like me, that basically just use a branch and the only thing that is modified when they do a commit is... well... the commit message.

This shell script was only tested in OS X, but should work in Linux/UNIX just fine.

Installation
------------

cp commit /usr/bin/commit; sudo +x /usr/bin/commit
